              Graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering, and
              having worked in the healthcare sector for three years, I am
              always avid in being hands on, learning new technologies and
              collaborating with others. I chose to abandon the path of
              tinkering with hardware to transition to software to fully expand
              on my creativity that I couldn't with hardware. Bringing my
              problem solving background and a team oriented mindset with me, I
              have shifted my career path to not just be a software
              developer/engineer but to be an effective critical thinker
              simultaneously. Outside of all this, I like to crack lame jokes,
              make memes, and having a good time with people :)
